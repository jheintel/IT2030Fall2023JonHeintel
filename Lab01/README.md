Web Application for

Jon's Cinematic Collection 

The JCC app will have a curated selection of movies that Jon himself finds 
imperative. A collection that is reviewed and rated with support for searching 
by genre and other criteria. The JCC will have cover pictures and possibly
stills to give the audience an idea of what to expect.

The JCC will also point the user in the direction of where to buy or stream 
the media. The collection might have in house purcheses or possible guide 
the user to outside retailers. The application should have features that make 
it easy to find movies you find interesting and can purchase.
